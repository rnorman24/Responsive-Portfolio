Who am I? I'm a man. I'm a father of two teenage children. I'm a chauffer of two teenage children. I'm a husband of 17 years. 

So you want to know about me. Well, it all started in a farming community  in rural Kansas with a lifestyle of working on farms, school, music, and sports. After high School I went on to receive a BS form Kansas State University. At that point I had a diploma in hand and no plan. So I ended up in Denver working construction. Soon after I realised my interest in technology and went to school in network administration, which opened the door to employment with IBM and later Alteon Web Systems.

And now for somthing completely, or perhaps somewhat, hyperbolic. Now I find myself standing on the Union Station platform to board the train of life, death, taxes and change. It will be a journey of hope to effect change for good by learning how to become a full stack developer, thus, contributing to human kind in a matter of humble persaverence, no matter the degree of grandiousity or minutness, whichever that may be. And so I prepare to head out into the great wide open, and with the help of providence, learn to fly ..... again.
