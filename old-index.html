    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="./assets/images/IMG_0691-200.jpg" alt="Raymond Norman" id="bio-image">
        <p>So, you want to know about me. Well, it all started in a farming community in rural Kansas with a lifestyle of working on farms, school, music, and sports. After high School I went on to receive a BS form Kansas State University. At that point I had a diploma in hand and no plan. Eventually, I ended up in Denver working construction. Soon after I realized my interest in technology and went to school in network administration, which opened the door to employment with IBM and later Alteon Web Systems.</p>

        <p>And now for something completely, or perhaps somewhat, hyperbolic. Now I find myself standing on the Union Station platform to board the train of life, death, taxes and <span>change</span>. It will be a journey of hope to effect <span>change</span> for good by learning how to become a <span>full stack developer</span>, thus, contributing to human kind in a matter of humble perseverance. Resulting in varying degrees of technical grandiosity which fall on the plus side of the development ledger. I now prepare to head out into the great wide open of <span>full stack development</span>, and with the help of providence, learn to fly ..... again.</p>
